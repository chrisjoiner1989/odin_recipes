    <h2>Best Lasagna Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is the perfect meal, and of all of the recipes I’ve tried over the
      years, this is the perfect lasagna. We loved it so much, we even turned it
      into Lasagna Roll Ups. It’s flavorful and satisfying, but also easy to
      make. It’s delicious as-is, but you can make it your own by swapping in
      your favorite ingredients.n our house, lasagna is a staple for busy school
      nights because it keeps, reheats, and freezes so well and it’s nice to
      have something in the fridge to enjoy throughout the week. I even use it
      for kids’ lunches—I pack a serving in my son’s thermos to keep it hot and
      that thermos comes home empty every time. Watch Natasha make this classic
      Lasagna Recipe. It’s the best lasagna we have tried, with the perfect
      balance of meat sauce to the three cheese sauce and noodles. That golden
      cheese crust seals in all the flavor and makes it irresistible. Here’s why
      you’ll love this recipe

    <h2>How to Make Lasagna</h2>
    <p>
      f you’d like to get a head start on this recipe, you can make the meat
      sauce a day or two in advance. That said, it’s still easy enough that you
      can make it all in one go, even for a weeknight dinner.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Brown the beef</strong></li>
      <p>
        -Add oil to a deep pan and sautee onion and beef until browned, 5
        minutes then add garlic and stir another minute.

      <li><strong>Finish the sauce</strong></li>
      <p>
        -Pour in 1/4 cup of wine and stir until almost evaporated. Add marinara,

        and cook 5 minutes.

      <li><strong>Make the cheese filling</strong></li>
      <p>

        a mixing bowl (reserve the rest for later).
      </p>
      <li><strong>Prep</strong></li>

    <h2>Common Questions</h2>

    <h3>Which is better for lasagna, cottage cheese or ricotta?</h3>
    <p>
      I use both; cottage cheese is healthier and ricotta is creamier, so you
      get the best of both worlds by using both of these cheeses in your
      lasagna.
    </p>
    <h3>Can I use no-boil lasagna noodles?</h3>
    <p>
      This lasagna recipe was developed with traditional lasagna noodles, but
      several readers have reported great results using no-boil noodles.
    </p>
    <h3>Can I substitute the red wine?</h3>
    <p>
      If you don’t have red wine, or prefer not to use it, you can substitute
      with beef broth or beef stock. The red wine adds great flavor but the
      lasagna will still be delicious with beef broth.
    </p>
    <h3>What is “al dente”?</h3>
    <p>
      Cooking al dente pasta means it should be “firm to the bite.” The package
      instructions will provide the cook time for pasta to reach al dente. Keep
      in mind, the lasagna will be baked for 45 minutes so do not overcook your
      lasagna noodles.
    </p>
    <h3>What is the best marinara sauce for lasagna?</h3>
    <p>
      Homemade marinara is definitely best, but if you don’t have time to make
      it, use your favorite store-bought marinara sauce.
    </p>
    <h3>Can I double the recipe?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, you can easily double this recipe, but you’ll need to bake the
      lasagna in two pans.
    </p>

    <h2>What to Serve with Lasagna</h2>

    <p>
